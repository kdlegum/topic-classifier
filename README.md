# topic-classifier
This project is a work in progress and is still at its very early stages.
A future web app for organising past papers and analysing strengths based on topics.
Students will be able to upload past papers and sentence transformers will be used to match each question to the correct topic.
This will allow students to more easily keep track of their progress.

## Topic Source
Students will be able to:
- Use an official specification if it is implemented
- Upload their own specification

## Past Paper Tracking
Students will still mark their papers themselves and input their marks on the web app.
A dashboard will show the strong and weak points and the percentage of marks lost over time for easy tracking of progress.
