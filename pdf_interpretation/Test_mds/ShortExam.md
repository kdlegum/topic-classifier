(b) Explain how the trapezium rule could be used to obtain a more accurate estimate for \( \int_0^2 x^2 e^{-x} dx \). [1]

(c) Explain why it is not clear from the diagram whether the value from part (a) is an under-estimate or an over-estimate for \( \int_0^2 x^2 e^{-x} dx \). [2]

2 You are given that \( y \) is inversely proportional to \( x^6 \) and \( z \) is directly proportional to the cube root of \( y \).

3 (a) Find a counterexample to disprove the statement that the product of two prime numbers is always odd.

(b) In each of the following cases write one of the symbols \( \Rightarrow, \Leftrightarrow, \Leftarrow \) in the box in the Printed Answer Booklet to make each statement correct.

(i) \( x^2 = 3x \) \( \qquad \qquad \qquad x = 3 \)

(ii) \( x > 4 \) \( \qquad \qquad \qquad x^3 > 64 \)

(iii) \( x^\circ = 45^\circ \) \( \qquad \qquad \qquad \tan x^\circ = 1 \)

(c) Prove that the sum of the squares of any two odd numbers is always a multiple of 2 but never a multiple of 4.

4 A sequence has terms \( u_1, u_2, u_3, \ldots \) defined by \( u_1 = 2 \) and \( u_{n+1} = 1 - \frac{1}{u_n} \) for \( n \geq 1 \).

(a) Find the values of \( u_2, u_3 \) and \( u_4 \).

(b) Describe the behaviour of the sequence.

(c) Given that \( \sum_{n=1}^k u_n = 73 \), determine the value of \( k \).

5 The line \( x + 13y = 108 \) is the normal to the curve \( y = ax^2 + b\sqrt{x} \) at the point (4, 8).

Determine the values of the constants \( a \) and \( b \).

6 In this question you must show detailed reasoning.

The cubic polynomial \( f(x) \) is defined by \( f(x) = 4x^3 - 25x^2 - 58x + 16 \).

(a) Show that \( x = \frac{1}{4} \) is a root of the equation \( f(x) = 0 \).

(b) Hence express \( f(x) \) as the product of a linear factor and a quadratic factor, with all terms in the factors having integer coefficients.

(c) Solve the equation \( 4e^{3y} - 25e^{2y} - 58e^y + 16 = 0 \), giving each root in the form \( y = k \ln 2 \) where \( k \) is a constant.
